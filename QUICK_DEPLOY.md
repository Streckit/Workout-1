## What If I Can't Access a Computer At All?

### Alternative 1: Use Online HTML Editor
Services like CodePen or JSFiddle let you:
- Write code on phone
- Get shareable link
- But won't work as well offline

### Alternative 2: Wait for Computer Access
- Keep these files safe
- When you get 5 minutes on any computer
- Deploy then
- App will work forever after

### Alternative 3: Ask a Friend
- Takes them 5 minutes
- They create the GitHub repo for you
- You get the URL
- You control it after

## Recommended Path

**Best Option:**
1. Go to library/friend's house
2. Use computer for 5 minutes
3. Follow Option 3 above
4. Get URL on your phone
5. Never need computer again

**Why?**
- Works better
- True offline support
- Free forever
- You control it
- Can update from phone later

## Files You Need to Upload

Make sure you have these 6 files:
- ✅ index.html
- ✅ app.js
- ✅ sw.js
- ✅ manifest.json
- ✅ README.md
- ✅ QUICK_DEPLOY.md (this file)

**Icons (optional):**
- icon-192.png
- icon-512.png

Without icons, app works but home screen icon is default.
You can add icons later.
